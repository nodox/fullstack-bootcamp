* Talk about the DOM and components of a web page
A web page is a document prepared to be read by a web browser so it can display the content of the page on the web.


## What is HTML?
A website is made up of a page or formally known as a document. To put information a website you need to
markup the page with a markup language, thats where HTML comes into play. **What is html?**

The `div` is the most common element on the page and its used to divide the page. The division helps us markup the page differently based on what we want to achieve.

## What is CSS ?
Markup is great but its so plain. What if we wanted to style the page with different colors so its not so plain? Or what if we wanted to style the actual markup elements, thats were CSS comes in. **What is CSS? Why called CSS?**. CSS is a design language used to describe how HTML elements are displayed to end users however they are being viewed (mobile, desktop, paper or other media).

## What is Javascript?
We've added the HTML elements and styled it with CSS. But our website looks real plain. I wonder if we can make it more lively. And the answer to that question is yes we can if we use Javascript. Javascript the the most popular web language today. Javascript is responsible for the way things interact on the web page. When you click a button, see a popup, or moving element then you are watching javascript code doing things to the web page. Let's make our page do something more interesting. We added the time we updated the website in markup but its been a while since, let's add a timer on our web page so we can see our page update live. To use javascript we are going to use a script element to run code. **What is a script?** Copy the following script just before the ending body tag.

...

Now reload the page. Our webpage now has a live timer. Sweet! There is so much you can do with javascript as a programming language.


## What is a programming language?
HTML and CSS are light versions of programming language becuase they are so simple in their design. They server primarily as a presentation layer for the content you want to describe. Javascript is the first major programming language we are going to cover. We are learning a new language we have to learn a few fundamental concepts once you learn these ideas you will be able to any programming language out there.

The reasons is because these languages all revolve around talking with a computer what we say to the computer has to be that same with each language but how we say it can be written in many ways as long as the fundmanetals are there. Take a moment to complete the [tutorial here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) to understand the syntax of javascript.

**Note: Write the book as a giant reference manual? Would be too long a book to talk about programming fundamentals such as variables and loops.**
