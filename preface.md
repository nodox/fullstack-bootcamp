# Preface


## Who this book is written for
*Full stack bookcamp* is designed for anyone with little or no programming experience. If you've ever wondered *What is coding? How do you code?* then this book is for you. In this book we will explore the fundamentals of programming as put those theories into practice as soon as we encounter them. 

The purpose of this book is to teach you web development with in such a way that you will the principles of software engineering. By the end of this book you will be able to build a custom web application using the proper tools. You will be able to dismantle complex application into their most basic fundamental unit and then build them yourself. You will develop a vocabulary that will demonstrate the knowledge you have as a software engineer. 

## How to get the most of this book
Each chapter is focused on creating a project we can show the world. As we create each project we will explore programming fundamentals. To get maximum benefit from this book make sure to physically type all the programming steps. Why? Doing so will help you commit the most important commands to memory. Typing out these commands will also allow you to see how much you understand what is in front of you because many of these commands require a specific order of execution. 

If you get stuck then jump over to the community section and post in one of the groups, so we can solve the problem together. If you can't figure out the problem then start over, these project won't be so hard so the more you practice implementing these projects the better you will be in the long run. 

We will briefly explore advanced concepts in each chapter as a way to give you insight on how deep the rabbit hole can go. When we touch upon this concept there will be external links you may chose to explore are a later time. Those links will continue to enhance your understand of software engineering.

## How to support this book and the community of learners
First and foremost thank for you supporting the creation of this book. With your help we can continue the mission of making software development a fun and accessible skill for everyone. When you succeed you'll tell everyone around one and hopefully you pay it forward by recogning this book as a starting point for building the foundation of your software engineering and web development. 

Email me at steven@fsbc.com if you have any issues, feedback or what to say hello. Email us your projects and we'll feature it in our monthly newsletter on everything thats going on in the programming world. As a beginner this weekly newsletter will be focused on turning you to all the  development communities around the web so you can know where to look whenever you are searching for anything related to software.

Our community can be found in the following places
    * Slack 
    * Facebook
    * Core website
All the code samples and projects will be publicly available on github for you to explore, clone, and modify. If you get stuck please post here so together we can create an archive of solved issues. I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I loved writing this book with the feedback of everyone involved in the community.
