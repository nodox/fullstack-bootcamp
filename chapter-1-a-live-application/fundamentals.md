## What is coding?
*What is coding?* Coding is the act of writing a bunch of commands in a text file and then giving it to the computer for the computer to perform those commands. The commands you write on the text file is called code. When you are opening files, creating folders, downloading ebooks or doing anything with our computer we are coding. However we aren't considered coders because the actions we performed have already been written for us. We are merely interacting with the code, that was written by someone else, and the computers or the persons code is responding to all the actions we are performing on the computer. 

## Getting to know your tools
To start you're journey as a coder or programmer you are going to need the right tools. There tools will allow you to run programs that perform the tasks you want completed. The first and most important tool is your computer.

### The computer and operating system
A computer is made of many parts. All these parts are parts can fall into one of two categories: hardware or software. The hardware of the computer are the physical parts that make the computer do things. Some notable parts are called the CPU, Memory also known as RAM, motherboard, and display, what you look into when you use the computer. These piece work to form the basic building blocks of a modern computer. Each piece has a set of instructions that can be called to perform a certain task but the hardware does not issue these tasks they only execute the task when they receive an order. 

Software is a set of program files that contain the logic or set of instructions, that are to be run by the user (either you or the copmuter itself). The instructions are passed down to the physical hardware where the command is executed to give a result. 

### What is the command line?
The command line is an application that allows us to interact with the computer by typing commands with our keyboard. When we type those commands and press enter, the computer works to complete the command. Every thing we do with a mouse can be done using terminal commands. The terminal however is sometimes better than using a mouse or what we see in front of use because it gives us more control over the computer. On Mac the command line application is called Terminal.

You can think of the terminal as driving an stick shift car. When driving stick you get more control of the car but you need to understand how the car works to make sure you are shifting correctly not breaking a gear in your car. The same concept applies with the terminal. With more control means we can issue better commands but we need to make sure we don't issue commands that can harm the computer. 

The terminal has many tools that are not normally useable when we use the computer with our mouse. Here is a fun exercise, do you remember what day of the week you were born? If you do you have great memory! If you are like the rest of us you might not remember however with the terminal you can find the answer in seconds. Open up your terminal and type

```
$ cal 1993
```

This commands lets us see what the calendar looks like for the year 1993. Instantly we can find the day we were born. Even if you don't learn how to code professionally learning even how to use the terminal for very simple things can make you extremely productive in your daily life. **Note: add more content about terminal commands, other fun exercises.** Install terminal or a command line equivalent onto your computer. This especially applies to Windows users, I recommend you use Gitbash or the linus subsystem if you are running windows 10.
