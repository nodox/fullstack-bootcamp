## What is coding?
Coding is the act of writing a bunch of commands in a text file and then giving it to the computer for the computer to perform those commands. The commands you write on the text file is called code. When you are opening files, creating folders, downloading ebooks or doing anything with our computer we are coding. However we aren't considered coders because the actions we performed have already been written for us. We are merely interacting with the code, that was written by someone else, and the computers or the persons code is responding to all the actions we are performing on the computer.

## What is a terminal?
The terminal is an application that allows us to interact with the computer by typing commands with our keyboard. When we type those commands and press enter, the computer works to complete the command. Every thing we do with a mouse can be done using terminal commands. The terminal however is sometimes better than using a mouse or what we see in front of use because it gives us more control over the computer. You can think of the terminal as driving an stick shift car. When driving stick you get more control of the car but you need to understand how the car works to make sure you are shifting correctly not breaking a gear in your car. The same concept applies with the terminal. With more control means we can issue better commands but we need to make sure we don't issue commands that can harm the computer. The terminal has many tools  that are not normally useable when we use the computer with our mouse. Here is a fun exercise, do you remember what day of the week you were born? If you do you have great memory! If you are like the rest of us you might not remember however with the terminal you can find the answer in seconds. Open up your terminal and type

```cal 1993```

This commands lets us see what the calendar looks like for the year 1993. Instantly we can find the day we were born. Even if you don't learn how to code professionally learning even how to use the terminal for very simple things can make you extremely productive in your daily life. **Note: add more content about terminal commands, other fun exercises,**


## What is a web page?
* Talk about the DOM and components of a web page
A web page is a document prepared to be read by a web browser so it can display the content of the page on the web. 


## What is HTML?
A website is made up of a page or formally known as a document. To put information a website you need to 
markup the page with a markup language, thats where HTML comes into play. **What is html?** 

The `div` is the most common element on the page and its used to divide the page. The division helps us markup the page differently based on what we want to achieve. 

## What is CSS ?
Markup is great but its so plain. What if we wanted to style the page with different colors so its not so plain? Or what if we wanted to style the actual markup elements, thats were CSS comes in. **What is CSS? Why called CSS?**. CSS is a design language used to describe how HTML elements are displayed to end users however they are being viewed (mobile, desktop, paper or other media).

## What is Javascript?
We've added the HTML elements and styled it with CSS. But our website looks real plain. I wonder if we can make it more lively. And the answer to that question is yes we can if we use Javascript. Javascript the the most popular web language today. Javascript is responsible for the way things interact on the web page. When you click a button, see a popup, or moving element then you are watching javascript code doing things to the web page. Let's make our page do something more interesting. We added the time we updated the website in markup but its been a while since, let's add a timer on our web page so we can see our page update live. To use javascript we are going to use a script element to run code. **What is a script?** Copy the following script just before the ending body tag.

...

Now reload the page. Our webpage now has a live timer. Sweet! There is so much you can do with javascript as a programming language. 


## What is a programming language?
HTML and CSS are light versions of programming language becuase they are so simple in their design. They server primarily as a presentation layer for the content you want to describe. Javascript is the first major programming language we are going to cover. We are learning a new language we have to learn a few fundamental concepts once you learn these ideas you will be able to any programming language out there. 

The reasons is because these languages all revolve around talking with a computer what we say to the computer has to be that same with each language but how we say it can be written in many ways as long as the fundmanetals are there. Take a moment to complete the [tutorial here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) to understand the syntax of javascript.

**Note: Write the book as a giant reference manual? Would be too long a book to talk about programming fundamentals such as variables and loops.**
