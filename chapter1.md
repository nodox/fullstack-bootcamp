# What is coding?
Coding is the act of writing a bunch of commands in a text file and then giving it to the computer for the computer to perform those commands. The commands you write on the text file is called code. When you are opening files, creating folders, downloading ebooks or doing anything with our computer we are coding. However we aren't considered coders because the actions we performed have already been written for us. We are merely interacting with the code, that was written by someone else, and the computers or the persons code is responding to all the actions we are performing on the computer.
