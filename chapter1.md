# What is coding?
Coding is the act of writing a bunch of commands in a text file and then giving it to the computer for the computer to perform those commands. The commands you write on the text file is called code. When you are opening files, creating folders, downloading ebooks or doing anything with our computer we are coding. However we aren't considered coders because the actions we performed have already been written for us. We are merely interacting with the code, that was written by someone else, and the computers or the persons code is responding to all the actions we are performing on the computer.

# What is a terminal?
The terminal is an application that allows us to interact with the computer by typing commands with our keyboard. When we type those commands and press enter, the computer works to complete the command. Every thing we do with a mouse can be done using terminal commands. The terminal however is sometimes better than using a mouse or what we see in front of use because it gives us more control over the computer. You can think of the terminal as driving an stick shift car. When driving stick you get more control of the car but you need to understand how the car works to make sure you are shifting correctly not breaking a gear in your car. The same concept applies with the terminal. With more control means we can issue better commands but we need to make sure we don't issue commands that can harm the computer. The terminal has many tools  that are not normally useable when we use the computer with our mouse. Here is a fun exercise, do you remember what day of the week you were born? If you do you have great memory! If you are like the rest of us you might not remember however with the terminal you can find the answer in seconds. Open up your terminal and type

```cal 1993```

This commands lets us see what the calendar looks like for the year 1993. Instantly we can find the day we were born. Even if you don't learn how to code professionally learning even how to use the terminal for very simple things can make you extremely productive in your daily life. **Note: add more content about terminal commands, other fun exercises,**
