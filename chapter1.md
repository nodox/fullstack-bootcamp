# What is coding?
Coding is the act of writing a bunch of commands in a text file and then giving it to the computer for the computer to perform those commands. The commands you write on the text file is called code. When you are opening files, creating folders, downloading ebooks or doing anything with our computer we are coding. However we aren't considered coders because the actions we performed have already been written for us. We are merely interacting with the code, that was written by someone else, and the computers or the persons code is responding to all the actions we are performing on the computer.

# What is a terminal?
The terminal is an application that allows us to interact with the computer by using our keyboard. On the terminal we type in commands for the computer to act on. Every thing we do with a mouse can be done using the terminal. The terminal however is sometimes better thatn using a mouse or what we see in front of use because it gives us more control of the computer. There are many tools avaliable on the computer that are not openly avaliable to use because we work at such a high level with the computer. Here is a fun exercise, do you remember what day of the week you were born? If you do you have great memory! If you are like the rest of us you might not remember however with the terminal you can find the answer in seconds. Open up your terminal and type

```cal 1993```

This commands lets us see what the calendar looks like for the year 1993. Instantly we can find the day we were born. Even if you don't learn how to code professionally learning even how to use the terminal for very simple things can make you extremely productive in your daily life. **Note: add more content about terminal commands, other fun exercises,**
