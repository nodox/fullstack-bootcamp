# A Teaching Philosophy
The goal of this book is to teach you the essential concepts of web development and help you become an effective software engineer. In this profession the only way to gain valuable experience is to practice. This book imploys a learn-while-practicing approach. 

In each chapter we are going to build an application. As we implement features we will learn about the techniques and technologies needed to build out the parts that will make up our application. 

The most important part for you is to sit down and physically type all the commands yourself. The reason why is because people learn best when they are engaged with the material. Typing the code snippets your self will not only familiarize you with key concepts but it will develop a habit for fixing typos and finding mistakes in your code, one of the most essential skills needed as a software engineer. These methods will establish the basics of debugging your own code.
