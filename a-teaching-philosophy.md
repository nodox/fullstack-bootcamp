# A Teaching Philosophy
The goal of this book is to teach you the essential concepts of web development and help you become an effective software engineer. To become an effective software engineer is to gain valuable experience. In order to gain valuable experience you need to practice building web applications. This book imploys a learn-while-practicing approach. 

The most important action for you to take while reading is to physically type  and run all the examples you will encounter. The reason why is because people learn best when they are engaged. Typing the code snippets your self will not only familiarize you with key concepts but it will develop a habit for fixing typos and finding mistakes in your code, one of the most essential skills needed as a software engineer.
