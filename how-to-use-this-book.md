## How to use this book
Each chapter is focused on creating a project we can show the world. As we create each project we will explore web development fundamentals. To get maximum benefit from this book make sure to physically type all the programming steps. Why? Doing so will help you commit the most important commands to memory. Typing out these commands will also allow you to see how much you understand what is in front of you because many of these commands require a specific order of execution. 

If you get stuck then jump over to the community section and post in one of the groups, so we can solve the problem together. If you can't figure out the problem then start over, these project won't be so hard so the more you practice implementing these projects the better you will be in the long run. 

We will briefly explore advanced concepts in each chapter as a way to give you insight on how deep the rabbit hole can go. When we touch upon this concept there will be external links you may chose to explore are a later time. Those links will continue to enhance your understand of software engineering.
