## How to use this book
Each chapter is focused on creating a project we can show the world. As we create each project we will explore web development fundamentals. To get maximum benefit from this book to physically type and run all the examples you will encounter as you read.

Why? Doing so will help you commit the most important commands to memory. Typing out these commands will also allow you to see how much you understand what is in front of you because many of these commands require a specific order of execution. Typing the code snippets your self will not only familiarize you with key concepts but it will develop a habit for fixing typos and finding mistakes in your code, one of the most essential skills needed as a software engineer.

If you get stuck then jump over to the community section and post in one of the groups, so we can solve the problem together. If you can't figure out the problem then start over. The more you practice implementing these projects the better you will be in the long run. 

We will explore advanced concepts in each chapter as a way to give you insight on how deep the rabbit hole can go. When we touch upon this concept there will be external links you may chose to explore at a later time. Each link will continue to enhance your understanding of software engineering.
