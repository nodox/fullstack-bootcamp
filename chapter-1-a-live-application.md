# Chapter 1: A live application
Our goal for this chapter is to deploy a simple application that has the words *Hello World* on a while web page. As we work our way through creating our application we will setup finally answer your question of *What is coding?*, create a development environment where you can code, explore our first simple programming languages: HTML and CSS. Finally we will end the chapter by putting or deploying our application to a public website you can show anybody on the web. Let's get started.
