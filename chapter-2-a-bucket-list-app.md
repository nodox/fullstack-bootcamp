# Chapter 2: A Hackernews 2.0 App
In this tutorial we are going to build a clone of the popular website Hackernews. Our app  will store a list of interesting articles on the web. We are going to learn two simple programming languages. HTML is used to set the structure of a web page. CSS is used style the web page and make it beautiful for our friends to see. Hackernews is pretty basic as it stands but since we're developers now we can bring the site into the twenthth century. Seriously reddit style website designs are so 1999.

Initially I thought about slowly building out our project structure and make ineffient processes more efficient as we went on but writing a book is a long painstalking process (ain't nobody got time for more blood to be spilled) I'm going to throw you right into the deep end and explain things as we go.
