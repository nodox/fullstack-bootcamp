# Chapter 2: A Hackernews 2.0 App
In this tutorial we are going to build a clone of the popular website Hackernews. Our app  will store a list of interesting articles on the web. We are going to learn two simple programming languages. HTML is used to set the structure of a web page. CSS is used style the web page and make it beautiful for our friends to see. Hackernews is pretty basic as it stands but since we're developers now we can bring the site into the twenthth century. Seriously reddit style website designs are so 1999.
