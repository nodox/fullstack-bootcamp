# Chapter 2: A Hackernews 2.0 App
In this tutorial we are going to build a clone of the popular website Hackernews. Our app  will store a list of interesting articles on the web. We are going to learn two simple programming languages. HTML is used to set the structure of a web page. CSS is used style the web page and make it beautiful for our friends to see. Hackernews is pretty basic as it stands but since we're developers now we can bring the site into the twenthth century. Seriously reddit style website designs are so 1999.

Initially I thought slowly you introducing you to complex applications but let's be honest life isn't fair so I'm going to throw you right into the deep end and explain things as we go. First things first, we need to create a project structure for our applications. We can either spend a couple weeks trying to figure our what is the most optimized way to build out our project structure while in the process not getting any coding done or do what 99.9% of all other lazy programmers do: let someone else do the hard work and clone their project!

Open your terminal application to clone a starter project from github.

```
$ git clone <NAME>
```
