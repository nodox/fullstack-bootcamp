# Introduction
The purpose of this book is to teach you how to become a software engineer. Software engineers are people who write programs that complete a specific task on a computer. Everywhere around you there are computers; microwaves, cars, video game consoles, cellphones, laptops, even watches are all considered computers. Each computer has its own specific set of rules for writing runnable programs on them. One of the most common themes among these computers is their ability to interact with the internet or web. Therefore learning how to program on the web serves as a starting point to teach you the fundamentals of software engineering. 

In this book we are going to train you in the art of web development. By the end of this book you will be able to build custom web applications using the proper tools. You will be able to dismantle complex application into their most basic fundamental unit and then build them yourself. You will develop a vocabulary that will demonstrate the knowledge you have as a software engineer. 

# Requirements
This book is designed for those with no programming experience. If you've ever wondered *What is coding? How do you code?* then this book is for you. In this book we will explore the fundamentals of programming and put those theories into practice.

# A Teaching Philosophy
The goal of this book is to teach you the essential concepts of web development and help you become an effective software engineer. To become an effective software engineer is to gain valuable experience. In order to gain valuable experience you need to practice building web applications. This book imploys a learn-while-practicing approach. As you read you will build projects that will teach you key software engineering concepts.
