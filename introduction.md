# Introduction
The purpose of this book is to teach you how to become a software engineer. Software engineers are people who write programs that complete a specific task on a computer. Everywhere around you there are computers; microwaves, cars, video game consoles, cellphones, laptops, even watches are all considered computers. Each computer has its own specific set of rules for writing runnable programs on them. One of the most common themes among these computers is their ability to interact with the internet or web. Therefore learning how to program on the web serves as a starting point to teach you the fundamentals of software engineering. 

In this book we are going to train you in the art of web development. By the end of this book you will be able to build custom web applications using the proper tools. You will be able to dismantle complex application into their most basic fundamental unit and then build them yourself. You will develop a vocabulary that will demonstrate the knowledge you have as a software engineer. 

# Requirements
This book is designed for those with no programming experience. If you've ever wondered *What is coding? How do you code?* then this book is for you. In this book we will explore the fundamentals of programming and put those theories into practice.

# A Teaching Philosophy
The goal of this book is to teach you the essential concepts of web development and help you become an effective software engineer. To become an effective software engineer is to gain valuable experience. In order to gain valuable experience you need to practice building web applications. This book imploys a learn-while-practicing approach. As you read you will build projects that will teach you key software engineering concepts.

## How to use this book
Each chapter is focused on creating a project we can show the world. As we create each project we will explore web development fundamentals. To get maximum benefit from this book to physically type and run all the examples you will encounter as you read.

Why? Doing so will help you commit the most important commands to memory. Typing out these commands will also allow you to see how much you understand what is in front of you because many of these commands require a specific order of execution. Typing the code snippets your self will not only familiarize you with key concepts but it will develop a habit for fixing typos and finding mistakes in your code, one of the most essential skills needed as a software engineer.

If you get stuck then jump over to the community section and post in one of the groups, so we can solve the problem together. If you can't figure out the problem then start over. The more you practice implementing these projects the better you will be in the long run. 

We will explore advanced concepts in each chapter as a way to give you insight on how deep the rabbit hole can go. When we touch upon this concept there will be external links you may chose to explore at a later time. Each link will continue to enhance your understanding of software engineering.

## Conventions

As you work through the book you will see these code blocks.

```$ cat test.txt```

These are the commands you will type into the terminal, an application used to issue commands to the computer. Or they will tell you the code you need to write into a file that will be run at a later time. 

When you encounter these first analyze them and then proceed to type them. Writing code this way will increase your ability to rememeber the commands later on. Sometimes you might see this type of `inline code` block. These will be used to identify names, certain outputs, or to reference the commands mentioned in the code block.
