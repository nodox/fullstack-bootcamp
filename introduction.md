# Introduction
The purpose of this book is to teach you how to become a software engineer. Software engineers are people who write programs that complete a specific task on a computer. Everywhere around you there are computers; microwaves, cars, video game consoles, cellphones, laptops, even watches are all considered computers. Each computer has its own specific set of rules for writing runnable programs on them. One of the most common themes among these computers is their ability to interact with the internet or web. Therefore learning how to program on the web serves as a starting point to teach you the fundamentals of software engineering. 

In this book we are going to train you in the art of web development. By the end of this book you will be able to build custom web applications using the proper tools. You will be able to dismantle complex application into their most basic fundamental unit and then build them yourself. You will develop a vocabulary that will demonstrate the knowledge you have as a software engineer.
