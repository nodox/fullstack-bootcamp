# Conventions

As you work through the book you will see these code blocks.

```$ cat test.txt```

These are the commands you will type into the terminal, an application used to issue commands to the computer. When you encounter these first analyze them and then proceed to type them. Writing code this way will increase your ability to rememeber the commands later on. 

Sometimes you might see this type of `inline code` block. These will be used to identify names, certain outputs, or to reference the commands mentioned in the code block.
